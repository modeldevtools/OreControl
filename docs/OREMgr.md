## TreeizeRelD (Treeize Relational Data)

TreeizeRelD was inspired by a javascript tool to treeize data (into JSON): [https://github.com/kwhitley/treeize](https://github.com/kwhitley/treeize)

The idea of both is to create a tree from a given set of related data tables (using the relational concept of primary and foreign keys).
