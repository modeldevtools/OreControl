open questions:

XSD schema completeness (types)
empty elements really required: DiscountCurves, CurveDescriptions in curveconfig.xml
empty modelparameters in pricingengine.xml required!

ordering of segements important in yield curve definitions (could this be done heuristically ?)

empty elements should be recognized in simulation.xml (and in general) before going for child nodes.
other elements that may be empty should be ignored if not available...

ordering of currencies in simulation.xml should not be important (should be ordered internally)
